## 📖 Project Overview

**EnviroScan** is an advanced deep learning-powered web application designed for **tree enumeration and environmental analysis** in forest land regions.  
The platform leverages **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once Version 8) — a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm — trained on custom datasets via **Roboflow** to deliver accurate tree analysis from satellite imagery.  
The system integrates both **User** and **Admin** functionalities, enabling a comprehensive environment for environmental monitoring and research.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

1. **Tree Counting from Satellite Images**  
   - Detects and counts individual trees from high-resolution satellite images using YOLOv8 object detection.

2. **Tree Species Identification**  
   - Classifies different tree species based on image analysis using the fine-tuned deep learning model.

3. **Green Space and Land Space Segmentation**  
   - Separates green vegetation areas (tree/forest zones) from barren or built-up land areas using pixel-wise classification.

4. **Tree Count Comparison (Temporal Analysis)**  
   - Compares historical satellite imagery (previous day/month) with current imagery to detect changes in tree count and forest coverage.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

- **Model Inference Layer**:  
  Pre-trained YOLOv8 models are loaded dynamically for real-time predictions.
  
- **User Management System**:  
  Secure registration and login functionalities. Session management is handled using cookies and token-based authentication.

- **Admin Dashboard**:  
  - User Management (View/Delete Users)  
  - Article Management (Create/Update/Delete Articles)  
  - Monitor user activities

- **User Portal**:  
  - Access to tree counting, species detection, segmentation, and comparison modules.  
  - Ability to read environmental articles posted by the Admin.

Would you also like me to generate a sample `requirements.txt` and a basic folder structure you can add too? 🚀  
It’ll make it even more professional if you’re planning to upload it to GitHub! 🎯
